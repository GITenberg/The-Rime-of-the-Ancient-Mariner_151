<meta name="description" content="The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (originally The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere) is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797â€“98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of Lyrical Ballads. Modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.

<p>IN SEVEN PARTS</p>
</div>

<p>By Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="I">PART THE FIRST.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din."</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>He holds him with his skinny hand,
"There was a ship," quoth he.
"Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>He holds him with his glittering eye--
The Wedding-Guest stood still,
And listens like a three years child:
The Mariner hath his will.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
He cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,
Merrily did we drop
Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the light-house top.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he!
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon--
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The bride hath paced into the hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry minstrelsy.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot chuse but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
And chased south along.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>With sloping masts and dipping prow,
As who pursued with yell and blow
Still treads the shadow of his foe
And forward bends his head,
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we fled.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold:
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as emerald.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--
The ice was all between.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around:
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in a swound!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>At length did cross an Albatross:
Thorough the fog it came;
As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hailed it in God's name.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
And round and round it flew.
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
The helmsman steered us through!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow,
And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariners' hollo!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine;
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,
Glimmered the white Moon-shine.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"God save thee, ancient Mariner!
From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--
Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross-bow
I shot the ALBATROSS.</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="II">PART THE SECOND.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Sun now rose upon the right:
Out of the sea came he,
Still hid in mist, and on the left
Went down into the sea.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And the good south wind still blew behind
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariners' hollo!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And I had done an hellish thing,
And it would work 'em woe:
For all averred, I had killed the bird
That made the breeze to blow.
Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay
That made the breeze to blow!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:
Then all averred, I had killed the bird
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,
That bring the fog and mist.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow followed free:
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent sea.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be;
And we did speak only to break
The silence of the sea!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>All in a hot and copper sky,
The bloody Sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the Moon.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor any drop to drink.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The very deep did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be!
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy sea.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And some in dreams assured were
Of the spirit that plagued us so:
Nine fathom deep he had followed us
From the land of mist and snow.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And every tongue, through utter drought,
Was withered at the root;
We could not speak, no more than if
We had been choked with soot.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
Had I from old and young!
Instead of the cross, the Albatross
About my neck was hung.</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="III">PART THE THIRD.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>There passed a weary time.  Each throat
Was parched, and glazed each eye.
A weary time! a weary time!
How glazed each weary eye,
When looking westward, I beheld
A something in the sky.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>At first it seemed a little speck,
And then it seemed a mist:
It moved and moved, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!
And still it neared and neared:
As if it dodged a water-sprite,
It plunged and tacked and veered.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could not laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
Agape they heard me call:
Gramercy! they for joy did grin,
And all at once their breath drew in,
As they were drinking all.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
Hither to work us weal;
Without a breeze, without a tide,
She steadies with upright keel!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The western wave was all a-flame
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave
Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,
With broad and burning face.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she nears and nears!
Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,
Like restless gossameres!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Are those her ribs through which the Sun
Did peer, as through a grate?
And is that Woman all her crew?
Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
Is DEATH that woman's mate?</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold:
Her skin was as white as leprosy,
The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,
Who thicks man's blood with cold.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The naked hulk alongside came,
And the twain were casting dice;
"The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"
Quoth she, and whistles thrice.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
At one stride comes the dark;
With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea.
Off shot the spectre-bark.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>We listened and looked sideways up!
Fear at my heart, as at a cup,
My life-blood seemed to sip!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The stars were dim, and thick the night,
The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
From the sails the dew did drip--
Till clombe above the eastern bar
The horned Moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip.</pre>

<pre>I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:

my heart as dry as dust.</pre>

<pre>Her beams bemocked the sultry main,

A still and awful red.</pre>

<pre>The silly buckets on the deck,

I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
And when I awoke, it rained.</pre>

I thought that I had died in sleep,

<div class="content">
<pre>And soon I heard a roaring wind:
It did not come anear;
But with its sound it shook the sails,
That were so thin and sere.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The upper air burst into life!
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,
To and fro they were hurried about!
And to and fro, and in and out,
The wan stars danced between.</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">

And the sails did sigh like sedge;

The Moon was at its edge.</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The thick black cloud was cleft, and still
The Moon was at its side:
Like waters shot from some high crag,
The lightning fell with never a jag,
A river steep and wide.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The loud wind never reached the ship,
Yet now the ship moved on!
Beneath the lightning and the Moon
The dead men gave a groan.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,
Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;
It had been strange, even in a dream,
To have seen those dead men rise.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;
Yet never a breeze up blew;
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do:
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
We were a ghastly crew.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The body of my brother's son,
Stood by me, knee to knee:
The body and I pulled at one rope,

<div class="content">
<pre>"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!
'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,
Which to their corses came again,
But a troop of spirits blest:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,
And clustered round the mast;
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,
And from their bodies passed.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the Sun;
Slowly the sounds came back again,
Now mixed, now one by one.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
I heard the sky-lark sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are,
How they seemed to fill the sea and air
With their sweet jargoning!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
And now it is an angel's song,
That makes the Heavens be mute.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It ceased; yet still the sails made on
A pleasant noise till noon,
A noise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night
Singeth a quiet tune.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Till noon we quietly sailed on,
Yet never a breeze did breathe:
Slowly and smoothly went the ship,
Moved onward from beneath.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,
The spirit slid: and it was he
That made the ship to go.
The sails at noon left off their tune,
And the ship stood still also.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Sun, right up above the mast,
Had fixed her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir,
With a short uneasy motion--
Backwards and forwards half her length
With a short uneasy motion.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Then like a pawing horse let go,
She made a sudden bound:
It flung the blood into my head,
And I fell down in a swound.</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life returned,
I heard and in my soul discerned
Two VOICES in the air.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
By him who died on cross,
With his cruel bow he laid full low,
The harmless Albatross.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"The spirit who bideth by himself
In the land of mist and snow,
He loved the bird that loved the man
Who shot him with his bow."</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quoth he, "The man hath penance done,
And penance more will do."</pre>

<pre>FIRST VOICE.</pre>
</div>

<pre>But tell me, tell me! speak again,
Thy soft response renewing--
What makes that ship drive on so fast?
What is the OCEAN doing?</pre>
</div>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SECOND VOICE.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Still as a slave before his lord,
The OCEAN hath no blast;
His great bright eye most silently
Up to the Moon is cast--</pre>

<pre>If he may know which way to go;

<div class="content">
<pre>FIRST VOICE.</pre>
</div>

Without or wave or wind?</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high
Or we shall be belated:
For slow and slow that ship will go,
When the Mariner's trance is abated.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>I woke, and we were sailing on
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;
The dead men stood together.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
All fixed on me their stony eyes,
That in the Moon did glitter.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never passed away:
I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
Nor turn them up to pray.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And now this spell was snapt: once more
I viewed the ocean green.
And looked far forth, yet little saw
Of what had else been seen--</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head;
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>But soon there breathed a wind on me,
Nor sound nor motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea,
In ripple or in shade.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek
Like a meadow-gale of spring--
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
Yet she sailed softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--
On me alone it blew.</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
The light-house top I see?
Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
Is this mine own countree!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray--
O let me be awake, my God!
Or let me sleep alway.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moonlight lay,
And the shadow of the moon.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steeped in silentness
The steady weathercock.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turned my eyes upon the deck--
Oh, Christ! what saw I there!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,
And, by the holy rood!
A man all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This seraph band, each waved his hand:
It was a heavenly sight!
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light:</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This seraph-band, each waved his hand,
No voice did they impart--
No voice; but oh! the silence sank
Like music on my heart.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>But soon I heard the dash of oars;
I heard the Pilot's cheer;
My head was turned perforce away,
And I saw a boat appear.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
The dead men could not blast.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>I saw a third--I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
The Albatross's blood.</pre>

<pre>This Hermit good lives in that wood
Which slopes down to the sea.
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with marineres
That come from a far countree.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
He hath a cushion plump:
It is the moss that wholly hides
The rotted old oak-stump.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,
"Why this is strange, I trow!
Where are those lights so many and fair,
That signal made but now?"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--
"And they answered not our cheer!
The planks looked warped! and see those sails,
How thin they are and sere!
I never saw aught like to them,
Unless perchance it were</pre>

</div>
<div class="literalblock">

<pre>"Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
My forest-brook along;

I am a-feared"--"Push on, push on!"
Said the Hermit cheerily.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>The boat came closer to the ship,
But I nor spake nor stirred;
The boat came close beneath the ship,
And straight a sound was heard.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread:
It reached the ship, it split the bay;
The ship went down like lead.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote,
Like one that hath been seven days drowned
My body lay afloat;
But swift as dreams, myself I found
Within the Pilot's boat.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,
The boat spun round and round;
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked
And fell down in a fit;
The holy Hermit raised his eyes,
And prayed where he did sit.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,
Laughed loud and long, and all the while
His eyes went to and fro.
"Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see,
The Devil knows how to row."</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>And now, all in my own countree,
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,
And scarcely he could stand.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"
The Hermit crossed his brow.
"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say--
What manner of man art thou?"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
With a woeful agony,
Which forced me to begin my tale;
And then it left me free.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Since then, at an uncertain hour,
That agony returns;
And till my ghastly tale is told,
This heart within me burns.</pre>
</div>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech;
That moment that his face I see,
I know the man that must hear me:
To him my tale I teach.</pre>

<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The wedding-guests are there:
But in the garden-bower the bride

electronic works</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<p>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a href="http://pglaf.org" class="bare">http://pglaf.org</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<p>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
